      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        My primary research interests lie in the areas of information behaviour, information and digital literacy, knowledge management, career development and lifelong learning.
        More broadly, I am interested in interdisciplinarity, mixed methods research and creative research methods.
      </p>
      <h2>Doctoral work</h2>
      <p>
        My doctoral research is concerned with young people’s career information literacy, and with their career information use for the purposes of career decision-making in an everyday context.
        My current work is guided by two objectives: (1) understanding young people’s career information behaviour and (2) developing tools to support their career information literacy.
